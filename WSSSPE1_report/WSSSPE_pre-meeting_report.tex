The First Workshop on on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE)\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk}} will be held on Sunday, 17 November 2013, in conjunction with the 2013 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC13)\footnote{\url{http://sc13.supercomputing.org}}.

Progress in scientific research is dependent on the quality and accessibility of software at all levels and it is now critical to address many challenges related to the development, deployment, and maintenance of reusable software. In addition, it is essential that scientists, researchers, and students are able to learn and adopt software-related skills and methodologies. Established researchers are already acquiring some of these skills, and in particular a specialized class of software developers is emerging in academic environments who are an integral and embedded part of successful research teams. The WSSSPE workshop was intended to provide a forum for discussion of the challenges, including both positions and experiences. The short papers and discussion were archived to provide a basis for continued discussion, and the workshop was intended to feed into the collaborative writing of one or more journal publications.

\section{Submissions}

The workshop call for paper included:

\begin{quote}
In practice, scientific software activities are part of an ecosystem where key roles are held by developers, users, and funders.  All three groups supply resources to the ecosystem, as well as requirements that bound it.  Roughly following the example of NSF's Vision and Strategy for Software (\url{http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf12113})~\cite{NSF_software_vision}, the ecosystem may be viewed as having challenges related to:

\begin{itemize}
\item the development process that leads to new software
\begin{itemize}
\item how fundamental research in computer science or science/engineering domains is turned  into reusable software
\item software created as a by-product of research
\item impact of computer science research on the development of scientific software
\end{itemize}
\item the support and maintenance of existing software, including software engineering
\begin{itemize}
\item governance, business, and sustainability models
\item the role of community software repositories, their operation and sustainability
\end{itemize}
\item the role of open source communities or industry
\item use of the software
\begin{itemize}
\item growing communities
\item reproducibility, transparency needs that may be unique to science
\end{itemize}
\item policy issues, such as
\begin{itemize}
\item measuring usage and impact
\item software credit, attribution, incentive, and reward
\item career paths for developers and institutional roles
\item issues related to multiple organizations and multiple countries, such as intellectual property, licensing, etc.
\item mechanisms and venues for publishing software, and the role of publishers
\end{itemize}
\item education and training
\end{itemize}

\end{quote}

Based on the goal of encouraging a wide range of submissions from those involved in software practice, ranging from initial thoughts and partial studies to mature deployments, the organizers wanted to make submission as easy as possible.  The call for papers stated:

\begin{quote}
We invite short (4-page) position/experience reports that will be used to organize panel and discussion sessions.  These papers will be archived by a third-party service, and provided DOIs. We encourage submitters to license their papers under a Creative Commons license that encourages sharing and remixing, as we will combine ideas (with attribution) into the outcomes of the workshop.  An interactive site will be created to link these papers and the workshop discussion, with options for later comments and contributions.  Contributions will be peer-reviewed for relevance and originality before the links are added to the workshop site; contributions will also be used to determine discussion topics and panelists.  We will also plan one or more papers to be collaboratively developed by the contributors, based on the panels and discussions.
\end{quote}

58 submissions were received, and almost all submitters used either arXiv\footnote{\url{http://arxiv.org}} or figshare\footnote{\url{http://figshare.com}} to self-publish their papers.  

\section{Peer-Review}

A peer review process followed the submissions, where the 58 papers received 181 reviews, an average of 3.12 reviews per paper.  Reviews were completed using a Google form, which allowed reviewers to provide scores on relevance and comments to the organizers, which were used to decide which papers to associate with the workshop, and comments to the authors, which were provided back to the authors to allow them to improve their papers.

The organizers decided to list 54 of the papers as significantly contributing to the workshop, a very high acceptance rate, but one that is reasonable, given the goal of broad participation and the fact that the reports were already self-published.  The papers were also grouped into 3 areas, each of which will be associated with a panel and discussion at the workshop.

\section{Conclusions}

The WSSSPE workshop has begun an experiment in how we can collaboratively build a workshop agenda.  However, contributors also want to get credit for their participation in the process.  And the workshop organizers want to make sure that the workshop content and their efforts are recorded.  Ideally, there would be a service that would be able to index the contributions to the workshop, serving the authors, the organizers, and the larger community.  But since there isn't such a service today, the workshop organizers are writing this initial report and making use of arXiv as a partial solution to provide a record of the workshop.

After the workshop, one or more additional papers will be created that will include the discussions at the workshop.  These papers will likely have many authors, and may be submitted to peer-reviewed journals.
